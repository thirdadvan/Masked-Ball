  deathDetail: Heart attack from overexcitement while watching the fire
  backstory: 'Jean-Pierre Morineau, fifty-seven years old, a wine importer.

    

    Once
    prosperous, deeply in debt at the time of his death.

    

    Three years
    ago, his business was still the most respectable French wine supplier in the
    city. He was a regular guest at high-society parties, his business card printed
    in four different languages. He believed his success would last forever - that
    his ascent would never stop.

    

    But two years ago, the market shifted.
    Young people began favoring craft beer and local low-alcohol fruit wines. His
    Bordeaux stock piled up, untouched, filling entire warehouses. One year ago,
    he turned to loan sharks to stay afloat, using the apartment building as collateral
    - the only inheritance his father had left him.

    

    Six months ago,
    he realized he could no longer repay his debts.

    

    That was when he
    began studying insurance policies.

    

    Fire insurance. Accident insurance.
    Property damage coverage.

    

    He calculated carefully: if the building
    burned down, the payout would be four to five times his total debt. Enough for
    a comeback. Enough to become that Jean-Pierre again - the one who dominated conversations
    at parties, glass in hand.

    

    He chose Saturday, 3:00 a.m.

    

    Most
    tenants would be asleep. The fire wouldn''t be extinguished too quickly. His
    wife and daughter were spending the weekend at his mother-in-law''s place in
    the countryside. And he himself - of course - would be perfectly absent, having
    gone out on a sudden late-night walk to clear his head.

    

    He never
    thought anyone would die.

    

    Or rather, he did - but he convinced himself
    otherwise. The fire alarm would go off. The fire brigade would arrive. The tenants
    weren''t idiots; they would run. At worst, a few floors would burn, the tenants
    would flee, and he would walk away with a check and a brand-new life.

    

    He
    watched the flames rise from a cafe across the street.

    

    His heart
    began to race.

    

    Not from fear.

    

    From excitement.

    

    When
    the windows on the fourth floor shattered and fire burst outward, he felt a pure,
    almost obscene thrill.

    

    This was his fire.

    His masterpiece.

    He
    was burning down the past with his own hands - welcoming the future.

    

    Then
    his heart stopped.

    

    When he died, a twisted, liver-colored grin was
    still frozen on his face.'

    (Pause.)

    

    He
    never imagined he could fail. Meticulous planning. Perfect timing. An airtight
    alibi. The only thing he didn''t account for was a heart too excited to keep
    beating.

    

    (Low chuckle.)

    

    What was he thinking when he
    died? The insurance payout? His new life? Or the people he set ablaze?

    

    The
    answer is: none of them.

    

    When he died, he was thinking - ''I won.'''
