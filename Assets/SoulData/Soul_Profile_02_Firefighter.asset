  deathDetail: "Smoke inhalation while rescuing a child from the burning building"
  backstory: "Thomas Brennan, thirty-four years old, a firefighter.\r\n\r\nFormer
    firefighter, technically. A work injury had ended his career \u2014 the permanent
    kind. Nerve damage in his left leg from a collapsed beam two years ago. He walked
    with a limp now, barely noticeable most days, but enough to fail the physical.\r\n\r\nHe
    wasn\u2019t supposed to be there that night.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019d told his fianc\xE9e
    he was visiting his parents upstate. In truth, he\u2019d driven to his old station,
    parked across the street, and just\u2026 sat there. Watching the trucks. Watching
    his old crew laugh through the garage doors.\r\n\r\nHe missed it. God, he missed
    it.\r\n\r\nWhen the call came in \u2014 structure fire, multiple victims reported
    \u2014 he followed the trucks. He wasn\u2019t thinking. He just followed.\r\n\r\nBy
    the time he arrived, the building was fully engulfed. His old captain saw him,
    shouted at him to stay back. \u201CYou\u2019re not on the roster, Brennan! Stay
    the hell back!\u201D\r\n\r\nHe stayed back.\r\n\r\nUntil he heard the child.\r\n\r\nFourth
    floor. A thin, high wail cutting through the roar of flames. The crew was focused
    on the lower floors \u2014 they hadn\u2019t heard it yet, or maybe they had and
    knew it was too late.\r\n\r\nThomas didn\u2019t think. He grabbed a spare coat
    and axe from an unmanned truck and went in.\r\n\r\nThe stairs were still intact,
    barely. He took them two at a time, his bad leg screaming. The smoke was thick,
    black, alive. He found the door \u2014 locked \u2014 and swung the axe until it
    splintered.\r\n\r\nThe girl was huddled in the corner, clutching a half-melted
    stuffed rabbit. She looked up at him with eyes that had already given up.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    be afraid,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nHe picked her up. She was so light.\r\n\r\nThey
    made it to the third floor landing before the ceiling gave way.\r\n\r\nHe shielded
    her with his body. Took the beam across his back. Kept moving.\r\n\r\nSecond
    floor. The smoke was impossible now. He couldn\u2019t see. Couldn\u2019t breathe.
    The girl had gone limp in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe made it three more steps before
    his lungs gave out.\r\n\r\nWhen they found him, he was curled around her, his
    body a shell. Neither of them made it.\r\n\r\nThe engagement ring was still in
    his pocket. He\u2019d been meaning to resize it."
