  deathDetail: "Smoke inhalation while rescuing a child from the burning building"
  backstory: "Thomas Brennan, thirty-four years old, a firefighter.\r\n\r\nFormer firefighter, technically. A work injury had ended his career - the permanent kind. Nerve damage in his left leg from a collapsed beam two years ago. He walked with a limp now, barely noticeable most days, but enough to fail the physical.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't supposed to be there that night.\r\n\r\nHe'd told his fiancee he was visiting his parents upstate. In truth, he'd driven to his old station, parked across the street, and just... sat there. Watching the trucks. Watching his old crew laugh through the garage doors.\r\n\r\nHe missed it. God, he missed it.\r\n\r\nWhen the call came in - structure fire, multiple victims reported - he followed the trucks. He wasn't thinking. He just followed.\r\n\r\nBy the time he arrived, the building was fully engulfed. His old captain saw him, shouted at him to stay back. \"You're not on the roster, Brennan! Stay the hell back!\"\r\n\r\nHe stayed back.\r\n\r\nUntil he heard the child.\r\n\r\nFourth floor. A thin, high wail cutting through the roar of flames. The crew was focused on the lower floors - they hadn't heard it yet, or maybe they had and knew it was too late.\r\n\r\nThomas didn't think. He grabbed a spare coat and axe from an unmanned truck and went in.\r\n\r\nThe stairs were still intact, barely. He took them two at a time, his bad leg screaming. The smoke was thick, black, alive. He found the door - locked - and swung the axe until it splintered.\r\n\r\nThe girl was huddled in the corner, clutching a half-melted stuffed rabbit. She looked up at him with eyes that had already given up.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe picked her up. She was so light.\r\n\r\nThey made it to the third floor landing before the ceiling gave way.\r\n\r\nHe shielded her with his body. Took the beam across his back. Kept moving.\r\n\r\nSecond floor. The smoke was impossible now. He couldn't see. Couldn't breathe. The girl had gone limp in his arms.\r\n\r\nHe made it three more steps before his lungs gave out.\r\n\r\nWhen they found him, he was curled around her, his body a shell. Neither of them made it.\r\n\r\nThe engagement ring was still in his pocket. He'd been meaning to resize it."
