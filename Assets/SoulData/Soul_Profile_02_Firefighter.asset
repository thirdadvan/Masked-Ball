  deathDetail: Smoke inhalation while rescuing a child from the burning building
  backstory: 'Thomas Brennan, thirty-four years old, a firefighter.

    

    Former
    firefighter, technically. A work injury had ended his career - the permanent
    kind. Nerve damage in his left leg from a collapsed beam two years ago. He walked
    with a limp now, barely noticeable most days, but enough to fail the physical.

    

    He
    wasn''t supposed to be there that night.

    

    He''d told his fiancee
    he was visiting his parents upstate. In truth, he''d driven to his old station,
    parked across the street, and just... sat there. Watching the trucks. Watching
    his old crew laugh through the garage doors.

    

    He missed it. God,
    he missed it.

    

    When the call came in - structure fire, multiple victims
    reported - he followed the trucks. He wasn''t thinking. He just followed.

    

    By
    the time he arrived, the building was fully engulfed. His old captain saw him,
    shouted at him to stay back. "You''re not on the roster, Brennan! Stay the hell
    back!"

    

    He stayed back.

    

    Until he heard the child.

    

    Fourth
    floor. A thin, high wail cutting through the roar of flames. The crew was focused
    on the lower floors - they hadn''t heard it yet, or maybe they had and knew it
    was too late.

    

    Thomas didn''t think. He grabbed a spare coat and
    axe from an unmanned truck and went in.

    

    The stairs were still intact,
    barely. He took them two at a time, his bad leg screaming. The smoke was thick,
    black, alive. He found the door - locked - and swung the axe until it splintered.

    

    The
    girl was huddled in the corner, clutching a half-melted stuffed rabbit. She looked
    up at him with eyes that had already given up.

    

    "Don''t be afraid,"
    he said.

    

    He picked her up. She was so light.

    

    They made
    it to the third floor landing before the ceiling gave way.

    

    He shielded
    her with his body. Took the beam across his back. Kept moving.

    

    Second
    floor. The smoke was impossible now. He couldn''t see. Couldn''t breathe. The
    girl had gone limp in his arms.

    

    He made it three more steps before
    his lungs gave out.

    

    When they found him, he was curled around her,
    his body a shell. Neither of them made it.

    

    The engagement ring was
    still in his pocket. He''d been meaning to resize it.'

    That''s
    what makes them so... useful.'
