  backstory: 'Rita Santos, twenty-eight years old, a temporary babysitter.

    

    She
    wasn''t supposed to be there that night. She''d gotten the job through an agency
    - last-minute booking, some woman who needed someone to watch her kid while she
    worked the night shift. Easy money.

    

    Rita had never met the kid before.
    Emily, seven years old, quiet, clingy. The kind of kid who looked at you with
    big eyes and asked too many questions.

    

    "Where''s Mommy?"

    

    "Working."

    

    "When
    is she coming back?"

    

    "Late."

    

    Rita made her dinner -
    microwave mac and cheese, the orange kind - and let her watch cartoons. The kid
    kept talking to her stuffed rabbit, having whole conversations with it. Weird,
    but whatever.

    

    Then her phone buzzed.

    

    Marco. Her on-again,
    off-again boyfriend. He was at a bar down the street. He wanted to see her. Tonight.

    

    Rita
    looked at the kid, already drowsy on the couch. It would only be an hour. Maybe
    two. The kid would be asleep the whole time. She''d never know.

    

    She
    put Emily to bed. The girl was being difficult - kept saying she wanted to go
    find her mommy. Rita didn''t have time for this.

    

    "Stay in your room,"
    she said. "Don''t come out."

    

    She locked the door. Just in case.
    Kids wandered. It wasn''t safe.

    

    The girl was still calling for her
    when Rita left.

    

    She''d given her something to help her sleep. Just
    a little. Crushed up in some candy. The kid would be out in ten minutes.

    

    Rita
    was at the bar when she heard the sirens.

    

    She ran. She ran all the
    way back to the building, pushed through the crowd, saw the flames pouring from
    the upper floors. Fourth floor. Where the kid was.

    

    She tried to
    go back in. She really did. But the smoke was so thick, and the heat was so intense,
    and she could hear people screaming, and she was scared.

    

    She ran
    for the stairs instead. If she could just get out, get away, pretend she was
    never there -

    

    She missed a step. Or someone pushed her. She never
    knew which.

    

    She remembered falling. She remembered the crack of
    her neck. She remembered lying at the bottom of the stairs, unable to move, watching
    people step over her.

    

    The key to Emily''s room was still in her
    pocket.

    

    She died thinking about Marco.'

  luciferRemark: 'At least she''s seen plenty in her lifetime.

    

    (Pause.)

    

    She
    had the key the whole time. She could have gone back. She could have unlocked
    that door.

    

    But she was scared. And then she was dead.

    

    (Soft
    laugh.)

    

    I wonder if she''ll ever stop thinking about that key.'
