  backstory: "Rita Santos, twenty-eight years old, a temporary babysitter.\r\n\r\nShe
    wasn\u2019t supposed to be there that night. She\u2019d gotten the job through
    an agency \u2014 last-minute booking, some woman who needed someone to watch
    her kid while she worked the night shift. Easy money.\r\n\r\nRita had never met
    the kid before. Emily, seven years old, quiet, clingy. The kind of kid who looked
    at you with big eyes and asked too many questions.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhere\u2019s
    Mommy?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWorking.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen is she coming back?\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLate.\u201D\r\n\r\nRita
    made her dinner \u2014 microwave mac and cheese, the orange kind \u2014 and let
    her watch cartoons. The kid kept talking to her stuffed rabbit, having whole
    conversations with it. Weird, but whatever.\r\n\r\nThen her phone buzzed.\r\n\r\nMarco.
    Her on-again, off-again boyfriend. He was at a bar down the street. He wanted
    to see her. Tonight.\r\n\r\nRita looked at the kid, already drowsy on the couch.
    It would only be an hour. Maybe two. The kid would be asleep the whole time.
    She\u2019d never know.\r\n\r\nShe put Emily to bed. The girl was being difficult
    \u2014 kept saying she wanted to go find her mommy. Rita didn\u2019t have time
    for this.\r\n\r\n\u201CStay in your room,\u201D she said. \u201CDon\u2019t come
    out.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe locked the door. Just in case. Kids wandered. It wasn\u2019t
    safe.\r\n\r\nThe girl was still calling for her when Rita left.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019d
    given her something to help her sleep. Just a little. Crushed up in some candy.
    The kid would be out in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nRita was at the bar when she heard
    the sirens.\r\n\r\nShe ran. She ran all the way back to the building, pushed
    through the crowd, saw the flames pouring from the upper floors. Fourth floor.
    Where the kid was.\r\n\r\nShe tried to go back in. She really did. But the smoke
    was so thick, and the heat was so intense, and she could hear people screaming,
    and she was scared.\r\n\r\nShe ran for the stairs instead. If she could just
    get out, get away, pretend she was never there\u2014\r\n\r\nShe missed a step.
    Or someone pushed her. She never knew which.\r\n\r\nShe remembered falling. She
    remembered the crack of her neck. She remembered lying at the bottom of the stairs,
    unable to move, watching people step over her.\r\n\r\nThe key to Emily\u2019s
    room was still in her pocket.\r\n\r\nShe died thinking about Marco."

    had the key the whole time. She could have gone back. She could have unlocked
    that door.\r\n\r\nBut she was scared. And then she was dead.\r\n\r\n(Soft laugh.)\r\n\r\nI
    wonder if she\u2019ll ever stop thinking about that key."
