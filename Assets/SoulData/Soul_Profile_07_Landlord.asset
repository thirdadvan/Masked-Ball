  backstory: "Harold Pike, sixty-three years old, the building's property manager.\r\n\r\nNot the owner - that was some corporation overseas. Harold was just the middleman. He collected rent, handled complaints, made sure the lights stayed on. He'd been doing it for fifteen years, ever since his wife died and he needed something to fill the days.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't a bad man. He told himself that every night. He wasn't bad - just practical.\r\n\r\nWhen the fire extinguishers expired, he didn't replace them. Too expensive. When the smoke detectors needed new batteries, he bought the cheapest ones, then forgot to install them. When the fire inspector came by two years ago and handed him a list of violations, he smiled, nodded, and filed the paper in a drawer.\r\n\r\nThe emergency exit on the second floor? Blocked with old furniture. He'd been meaning to clear it out for months. The fire escape? Rusted, shaky, probably unsafe. But repairs cost money, and the corporation never approved anything that didn't directly generate revenue.\r\n\r\nHarold knew the building was a deathtrap. He'd known for years. But nothing ever happened. Nothing ever would. Bad things happened to other people, in other buildings.\r\n\r\nUntil they didn't.\r\n\r\nThe night of the fire, Harold was the first to smell smoke. He lived on the ground floor, closest to where it started. He had time to get out. Plenty of time.\r\n\r\nHe didn't warn anyone. Didn't pull the alarm. Didn't pound on doors. He just grabbed his wallet, his keys, and his calculator, and headed for the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe stairwell was already filling with smoke. People were pushing, shoving, screaming. Harold's bad hip slowed him down. He couldn't keep up.\r\n\r\nSomewhere around the third floor, someone pushed him.\r\n\r\nHe remembered falling. He remembered the crack of his cane breaking. He remembered lying at the bottom of the landing, unable to move, watching feet step over him as people ran past.\r\n\r\nNo one stopped.\r\n\r\nThe smoke got him before the fire did. He lay there, conscious until the very end, watching the orange light flicker above him, thinking about fire extinguishers and smoke detectors and all the repairs he'd never made.\r\n\r\nThe corporation settled out of court. No one was held responsible.\r\n\r\nHarold Pike was listed as just another victim."

  luciferRemark: "What's that phrase? 'Acceptable business risk'?\r\n\r\n(Pause.)\r\n\r\nHe knew. He always knew. Every expired extinguisher, every dead battery, every blocked exit - he knew exactly what he was doing.\r\n\r\nBut it was never his fault, was it? The corporation wouldn't pay. The tenants didn't complain. The inspector could be ignored.\r\n\r\n(Soft laugh.)\r\n\r\nSomeone pushed him on the stairs. How very appropriate."
