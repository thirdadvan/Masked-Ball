  deathDetail: "Smoke inhalation while waiting for someone else to handle the fire"
  backstory: "Eileen Walsh, forty-one years old, an accountant.\r\n\r\nShe worked
    sixty hours a week at a mid-sized firm downtown. Numbers. Spreadsheets. Quarterly
    reports. Her life was measured in billable hours and coffee cups.\r\n\r\nShe
    lived alone in a small apartment on the third floor. No pets \u2014 she was never
    home enough to take care of one. No plants \u2014 they always died. Just her,
    a bed, and an alarm clock she\u2019d learned to hate.\r\n\r\nThat night, she\u2019d
    gotten home at 11 PM. Late, but not unusually so. Tax season was coming. Everyone
    was pulling long hours.\r\n\r\nShe was so tired.\r\n\r\nShe didn\u2019t shower.
    Didn\u2019t eat. Just fell into bed with her work clothes still on, too exhausted
    to even take off her shoes.\r\n\r\nAt 3:17 AM, she smelled smoke.\r\n\r\nShe
    thought about getting up. She really did. But her body felt like lead. Her eyes
    wouldn\u2019t open all the way. Surely someone else had already called the fire
    department. Surely someone was handling it.\r\n\r\nJust one more minute.\r\n\r\nShe
    heard shouting in the hallway. Footsteps. Someone pounding on doors. She should
    get up. She knew she should get up.\r\n\r\nBut she was so tired.\r\n\r\nJust
    one more minute.\r\n\r\nThe smoke got thicker. She could see it now, curling
    under her door, orange light flickering through the gap. She reached for her
    phone. Dead \u2014 she\u2019d forgotten to charge it.\r\n\r\nShe should get up.\r\n\r\nShe
    didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\nWhen they found her body, she was still in bed. The covers
    pulled up to her chin. Her eyes closed. She looked almost peaceful.\r\n\r\nThe
    coroner said she probably never fully woke up. The smoke got her before the flames
    did.\r\n\r\nBut that wasn\u2019t quite true. In her last moments, as the darkness
    closed in, Eileen Walsh was thinking one thing:\r\n\r\nJust one more minute.\r\n\r\nSomeone
    else will handle it."
