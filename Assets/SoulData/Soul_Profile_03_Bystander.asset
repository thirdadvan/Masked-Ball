  backstory: 'Eileen Walsh, forty-one years old, an accountant.

    

    She
    worked sixty hours a week at a mid-sized firm downtown. Numbers. Spreadsheets.
    Quarterly reports. Her life was measured in billable hours and coffee cups.

    

    She
    lived alone in a small apartment on the third floor. No pets - she was never
    home enough to take care of one. No plants - they always died. Just her, a bed,
    and an alarm clock she''d learned to hate.

    

    That night, she''d gotten
    home at 11 PM. Late, but not unusually so. Tax season was coming. Everyone was
    pulling long hours.

    

    She was so tired.

    

    She didn''t shower.
    Didn''t eat. Just fell into bed with her work clothes still on, too exhausted
    to even take off her shoes.

    

    At 3:17 AM, she smelled smoke.

    

    She
    thought about getting up. She really did. But her body felt like lead. Her eyes
    wouldn''t open all the way. Surely someone else had already called the fire department.
    Surely someone was handling it.

    

    Just one more minute.

    

    She
    heard shouting in the hallway. Footsteps. Someone pounding on doors. She should
    get up. She knew she should get up.

    

    But she was so tired.

    

    Just
    one more minute.

    

    The smoke got thicker. She could see it now, curling
    under her door, orange light flickering through the gap. She reached for her
    phone. Dead - she''d forgotten to charge it.

    

    She should get up.

    

    She
    didn''t.

    

    When they found her body, she was still in bed. The covers
    pulled up to her chin. Her eyes closed. She looked almost peaceful.

    

    The
    coroner said she probably never fully woke up. The smoke got her before the flames
    did.

    

    But that wasn''t quite true. In her last moments, as the darkness
    closed in, Eileen Walsh was thinking one thing:

    

    Just one more minute.

    

    Someone
    else will handle it.'

  skullRemark: She didn't do anything bad. But she didn't do anything at all. What
    does that count as?
  luciferRemark: '''Just wait a little longer'' - what gentle words.

    

    (Pause.)

    

    And
    then there was no ''then.''

    

    Sloth is such a quiet sin. No malice.
    No intent. Just... absence. The sin of the empty chair. The unanswered call.
    The door that stayed closed.

    

    She never hurt anyone. She simply wasn''t
    there when it mattered.'
