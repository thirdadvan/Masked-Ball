  backstory: "Vincent Ramos, fifty-one years old, a career thief.\r\n\r\nTwenty years
    in the trade. He specialized in lonely old people \u2014 they were easy marks.
    Bad eyesight, slow reflexes, too proud to install security systems. He\u2019d
    learned their routines, their habits, the hiding places where they kept their
    treasures.\r\n\r\nHe wasn\u2019t a violent man. He\u2019d never hurt anyone. He
    just took what they didn\u2019t need \u2014 what they\u2019d never miss until
    it was too late.\r\n\r\nThat night, he was in the building casing a mark. Fourth
    floor \u2014 a retired professor who lived alone. Word on the street was the
    old man had silver, antiques, maybe some old coins. Easy pickings.\r\n\r\nThen
    the fire started.\r\n\r\nVincent\u2019s first instinct was to run. Self-preservation
    \u2014 the only code he\u2019d ever lived by. But the smoke was already thick
    in the hallway, and he could hear people screaming behind locked doors.\r\n\r\nHe
    had his lockpicks with him. Tools of the trade.\r\n\r\nHe didn\u2019t think about
    it. He just started picking locks. First door \u2014 an old couple, terrified,
    couldn\u2019t find their keys. He got them out. Second door \u2014 a grandmother
    and her grandson, the kid crying, the old woman too weak to walk. He carried
    her down two flights of stairs.\r\n\r\nThree people. He saved three people.\r\n\r\nAnd
    then, as he caught his breath on the street, watching the flames climb higher,
    he remembered.\r\n\r\nThe professor. Fourth floor. The silver. The antiques.\r\n\r\nThe
    building was still standing. The fire hadn\u2019t reached that floor yet. And
    everyone was distracted \u2014 firefighters, victims, bystanders. No one would
    notice one more person slipping back inside.\r\n\r\nIt would be quick. In and
    out. He\u2019d earned it, hadn\u2019t he? Three lives \u2014 surely that was
    worth a little silver.\r\n\r\nHe went back in.\r\n\r\nThe smoke was worse than
    he expected. Much worse. He made it to the fourth floor, found the professor\u2019s
    apartment, picked the lock. The old man was gone \u2014 evacuated, probably.
    Good.\r\n\r\nVincent found the silver cigarette case first. Engraved, antique,
    worth a small fortune. He slipped it into his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe was reaching
    for the mantel clock when the smoke finally caught up with him.\r\n\r\nThey found
    his body three days later, buried under debris. His hand was still clutching
    the cigarette case. His pockets were full of other people\u2019s treasures \u2014
    a gold ring, a pearl necklace, pawn tickets for items he\u2019d already sold.\r\n\r\nThe
    three people he saved attended his funeral. None of them knew about the fourth
    floor."
