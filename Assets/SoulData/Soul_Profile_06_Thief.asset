  backstory: 'Vincent Ramos, fifty-one years old, a career thief.

    

    Twenty
    years in the trade. He specialized in lonely old people - they were easy marks.
    Bad eyesight, slow reflexes, too proud to install security systems. He''d learned
    their routines, their habits, the hiding places where they kept their treasures.

    

    He
    wasn''t a violent man. He''d never hurt anyone. He just took what they didn''t
    need - what they''d never miss until it was too late.

    

    That night,
    he was in the building casing a mark. Fourth floor - a retired professor who
    lived alone. Word on the street was the old man had silver, antiques, maybe some
    old coins. Easy pickings.

    

    Then the fire started.

    

    Vincent''s
    first instinct was to run. Self-preservation - the only code he''d ever lived
    by. But the smoke was already thick in the hallway, and he could hear people
    screaming behind locked doors.

    

    He had his lockpicks with him. Tools
    of the trade.

    

    He didn''t think about it. He just started picking
    locks. First door - an old couple, terrified, couldn''t find their keys. He got
    them out. Second door - a grandmother and her grandson, the kid crying, the old
    woman too weak to walk. He carried her down two flights of stairs.

    

    Three
    people. He saved three people.

    

    And then, as he caught his breath
    on the street, watching the flames climb higher, he remembered.

    

    The
    professor. Fourth floor. The silver. The antiques.

    

    The building
    was still standing. The fire hadn''t reached that floor yet. And everyone was
    distracted - firefighters, victims, bystanders. No one would notice one more
    person slipping back inside.

    

    It would be quick. In and out. He''d
    earned it, hadn''t he? Three lives - surely that was worth a little silver.

    

    He
    went back in.

    

    The smoke was worse than he expected. Much worse.
    He made it to the fourth floor, found the professor''s apartment, picked the
    lock. The old man was gone - evacuated, probably. Good.

    

    Vincent
    found the silver cigarette case first. Engraved, antique, worth a small fortune.
    He slipped it into his pocket.

    

    He was reaching for the mantel clock
    when the smoke finally caught up with him.

    

    They found his body three
    days later, buried under debris. His hand was still clutching the cigarette case.
    His pockets were full of other people''s treasures - a gold ring, a pearl necklace,
    pawn tickets for items he''d already sold.

    

    The three people he saved
    attended his funeral. None of them knew about the fourth floor.'

    Three

    He
    had a chance to be something better. For one brief moment, he was. And then...

    laugh.)
