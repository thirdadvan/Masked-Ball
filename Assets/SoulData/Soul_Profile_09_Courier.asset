  backstory: "Marcus Lee, twenty-four years old, a delivery driver.\r\n\r\nHe lived with his mother in a small apartment across town. His father had left when he was twelve. His mother worked two jobs to keep them afloat. When Marcus graduated high school, he didn't go to college. He got a job instead - delivering packages, making just enough to help with rent.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't anyone special. That's what he always told himself. Just a guy with a van and a route. Nobody important.\r\n\r\nThat night, he was finishing his last delivery. Late shift - overtime pay. He was tired, hungry, thinking about the sandwich his mom had packed for him, still uneaten in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe saw the flames from two blocks away.\r\n\r\nHe should have kept driving. It wasn't his building. It wasn't his problem. The fire department was probably already on the way.\r\n\r\nBut he knew this building. He delivered here three times a week. He knew the old couple on the second floor who always tipped him. He knew the grandmother on the third floor who gave him candy. He knew their faces, their names, their apartment numbers.\r\n\r\nHe pulled over. He didn't think. He just ran.\r\n\r\nThe first trip, he carried out the old couple. They were confused, disoriented, barely able to walk. He put them on the sidewalk and went back in.\r\n\r\nThe second trip, he found the grandmother. She was heavier than she looked. His arms were shaking by the time he got her outside.\r\n\r\nSomeone told him there were still people trapped on the upper floors. He didn't hesitate.\r\n\r\nThe third trip, he didn't come back.\r\n\r\nThey found his body two days later, in the stairwell between the third and fourth floors. He'd been trying to reach someone. The smoke got him first.\r\n\r\nHis mother identified the body. She didn't cry - she just stood there, holding the crumpled sandwich wrapper they'd found in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe delivery company sent flowers to the funeral. His route was reassigned the next day.\r\n\r\nHe wasn't anyone special. Just a guy who ran into a burning building because he recognized the faces."
