  backstory: 'Marcus Lee, twenty-four years old, a delivery driver.

    

    He
    lived with his mother in a small apartment across town. His father had left when
    he was twelve. His mother worked two jobs to keep them afloat. When Marcus graduated
    high school, he didn''t go to college. He got a job instead - delivering packages,
    making just enough to help with rent.

    

    He wasn''t anyone special.
    That''s what he always told himself. Just a guy with a van and a route. Nobody
    important.

    

    That night, he was finishing his last delivery. Late
    shift - overtime pay. He was tired, hungry, thinking about the sandwich his mom
    had packed for him, still uneaten in his pocket.

    

    He saw the flames
    from two blocks away.

    

    He should have kept driving. It wasn''t his
    building. It wasn''t his problem. The fire department was probably already on
    the way.

    

    But he knew this building. He delivered here three times
    a week. He knew the old couple on the second floor who always tipped him. He
    knew the grandmother on the third floor who gave him candy. He knew their faces,
    their names, their apartment numbers.

    

    He pulled over. He didn''t
    think. He just ran.

    

    The first trip, he carried out the old couple.
    They were confused, disoriented, barely able to walk. He put them on the sidewalk
    and went back in.

    

    The second trip, he found the grandmother. She
    was heavier than she looked. His arms were shaking by the time he got her outside.

    

    Someone
    told him there were still people trapped on the upper floors. He didn''t hesitate.

    

    The
    third trip, he didn''t come back.

    

    They found his body two days later,
    in the stairwell between the third and fourth floors. He''d been trying to reach
    someone. The smoke got him first.

    

    His mother identified the body.
    She didn''t cry - she just stood there, holding the crumpled sandwich wrapper
    they''d found in his pocket.

    

    The delivery company sent flowers to
    the funeral. His route was reassigned the next day.

    

    He wasn''t anyone
    special. Just a guy who ran into a burning building because he recognized the
    faces.'

    (Long pause.)

    

    He didn''t
    have to go in. He wasn''t a firefighter. He wasn''t a hero. He was just a delivery
    boy with a sandwich in his pocket.

    

    And yet.

    

    (Softer.)

    

    There''s
    nothing else to say about this one.'
