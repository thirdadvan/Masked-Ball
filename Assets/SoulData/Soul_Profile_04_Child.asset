  deathDetail: Smoke inhalation, locked in her room by the babysitter
  backstory: 'Emily Chen, seven years old, first grade.

    

    She lived with
    her mother in a small apartment on the fourth floor. Her father had left before
    she was born - she''d never met him. Her mother worked nights at a restaurant
    downtown, sometimes two shifts back to back.

    

    Emily was used to being
    alone.

    

    That night, her mother had hired a babysitter - a young woman
    from the agency, someone Emily had never met before. The babysitter had seemed
    nice at first. She''d made Emily dinner, let her watch cartoons.

    

    But
    then the babysitter''s phone rang.

    

    "Stay in your room," she told
    Emily. "Don''t come out until I get back."

    

    Emily heard the lock
    click. She heard the front door open and close.

    

    She sat on her bed
    with her stuffed rabbit, Mr. Whiskers, and waited. She was a good girl. She knew
    how to wait.

    

    She didn''t know how much time passed. She might have
    fallen asleep.

    

    She woke up to heat. To the smell of something burning.
    Orange light was flickering under her door, and the air was getting hard to breathe.

    

    She
    tried the door. Locked.

    

    She screamed. She pounded. She cried for
    her mother, for anyone.

    

    No one came.

    

    She retreated
    to the corner of her room, hugging Mr. Whiskers, making herself as small as possible.
    The smoke was everywhere now, thick and black, stinging her eyes, filling her
    lungs.

    

    Then the door exploded inward.

    

    A man in a heavy
    coat. He picked her up. He smelled like smoke and sweat and something metallic.

    

    "I''m
    scared," she told him.

    

    "Don''t be afraid," he said.

    

    She
    believed him.

    

    She doesn''t remember what happened after that. Just
    darkness. Just peace.

    

    When they found her, she was still in the
    firefighter''s arms. Her small fingers were clutched around his collar. Mr. Whiskers
    was pressed between them, half-melted, cotton spilling out.

    

    Her
    mother identified the body the next morning. She didn''t cry. She just stared.

    

    The
    coroner found something else in Emily''s stomach. Residue from sleeping pills
    - the kind you''d give an adult, not a child. Crushed up. Mixed into something
    sweet.'
