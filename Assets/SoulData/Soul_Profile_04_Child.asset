  deathDetail: "Smoke inhalation, locked in her room by the babysitter"
  backstory: "Emily Chen, seven years old, first grade.\r\n\r\nShe lived with her
    mother in a small apartment on the fourth floor. Her father had left before she
    was born \u2014 she\u2019d never met him. Her mother worked nights at a restaurant
    downtown, sometimes two shifts back to back.\r\n\r\nEmily was used to being alone.\r\n\r\nThat
    night, her mother had hired a babysitter \u2014 a young woman from the agency,
    someone Emily had never met before. The babysitter had seemed nice at first.
    She\u2019d made Emily dinner, let her watch cartoons.\r\n\r\nBut then the babysitter\u2019s
    phone rang.\r\n\r\n\u201CStay in your room,\u201D she told Emily. \u201CDon\u2019t
    come out until I get back.\u201D\r\n\r\nEmily heard the lock click. She heard
    the front door open and close.\r\n\r\nShe sat on her bed with her stuffed rabbit,
    Mr. Whiskers, and waited. She was a good girl. She knew how to wait.\r\n\r\nShe
    didn\u2019t know how much time passed. She might have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nShe
    woke up to heat. To the smell of something burning. Orange light was flickering
    under her door, and the air was getting hard to breathe.\r\n\r\nShe tried the
    door. Locked.\r\n\r\nShe screamed. She pounded. She cried for her mother, for
    anyone.\r\n\r\nNo one came.\r\n\r\nShe retreated to the corner of her room, hugging
    Mr. Whiskers, making herself as small as possible. The smoke was everywhere now,
    thick and black, stinging her eyes, filling her lungs.\r\n\r\nThen the door exploded
    inward.\r\n\r\nA man in a heavy coat. He picked her up. He smelled like smoke
    and sweat and something metallic.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m scared,\u201D she told
    him.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t be afraid,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nShe believed him.\r\n\r\nShe
    doesn\u2019t remember what happened after that. Just darkness. Just peace.\r\n\r\nWhen
    they found her, she was still in the firefighter\u2019s arms. Her small fingers
    were clutched around his collar. Mr. Whiskers was pressed between them, half-melted,
    cotton spilling out.\r\n\r\nHer mother identified the body the next morning.
    She didn\u2019t cry. She just stared.\r\n\r\nThe coroner found something else
    in Emily\u2019s stomach. Residue from sleeping pills \u2014 the kind you\u2019d
    give an adult, not a child. Crushed up. Mixed into something sweet."
