  deathDetail: "Smoke inhalation, locked in her room by the babysitter"
  backstory: "Emily Chen, seven years old, first grade.\r\n\r\nShe lived with her mother in a small apartment on the fourth floor. Her father had left before she was born - she'd never met him. Her mother worked nights at a restaurant downtown, sometimes two shifts back to back.\r\n\r\nEmily was used to being alone.\r\n\r\nThat night, her mother had hired a babysitter - a young woman from the agency, someone Emily had never met before. The babysitter had seemed nice at first. She'd made Emily dinner, let her watch cartoons.\r\n\r\nBut then the babysitter's phone rang.\r\n\r\n\"Stay in your room,\" she told Emily. \"Don't come out until I get back.\"\r\n\r\nEmily heard the lock click. She heard the front door open and close.\r\n\r\nShe sat on her bed with her stuffed rabbit, Mr. Whiskers, and waited. She was a good girl. She knew how to wait.\r\n\r\nShe didn't know how much time passed. She might have fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nShe woke up to heat. To the smell of something burning. Orange light was flickering under her door, and the air was getting hard to breathe.\r\n\r\nShe tried the door. Locked.\r\n\r\nShe screamed. She pounded. She cried for her mother, for anyone.\r\n\r\nNo one came.\r\n\r\nShe retreated to the corner of her room, hugging Mr. Whiskers, making herself as small as possible. The smoke was everywhere now, thick and black, stinging her eyes, filling her lungs.\r\n\r\nThen the door exploded inward.\r\n\r\nA man in a heavy coat. He picked her up. He smelled like smoke and sweat and something metallic.\r\n\r\n\"I'm scared,\" she told him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be afraid,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe believed him.\r\n\r\nShe doesn't remember what happened after that. Just darkness. Just peace.\r\n\r\nWhen they found her, she was still in the firefighter's arms. Her small fingers were clutched around his collar. Mr. Whiskers was pressed between them, half-melted, cotton spilling out.\r\n\r\nHer mother identified the body the next morning. She didn't cry. She just stared.\r\n\r\nThe coroner found something else in Emily's stomach. Residue from sleeping pills - the kind you'd give an adult, not a child. Crushed up. Mixed into something sweet."
