  deathDetail: overexcitement while watching the fire scene
  backstory: "Jean-Pierre Morineau, fifty-seven years old, an importer of fine wines.
    \r\nOnce prosperous, deeply in debt at the time of his death. \r\n\r\nThree years
    ago, his business was still the most respectable French wine supplier in the
    city. He was a regular guest at high-society parties, his business card printed
    in four different languages. He believed his success would last forever \u2014
    that his ascent would never stop. \r\n\r\nBut two years ago, the market shifted.
    Young people began favoring craft beer and local low-alcohol fruit wines. His
    Bordeaux stock piled up, untouched, filling entire warehouses. One year ago,
    he turned to loan sharks to stay afloat, using the apartment building as collateral
    \u2014 the only inheritance his father had left him. \r\n\r\nSix months ago,
    he realized he could no longer repay his debts. \r\n\r\nThat was when he began
    studying insurance policies. \r\n\r\nFire insurance. Accident insurance. Property
    damage coverage. \r\n\r\nHe calculated carefully: if the building burned down,
    the payout would be four to five times his total debt. Enough for a comeback.
    Enough to become that Jean-Pierre again \u2014 the one who dominated conversations
    at parties, glass in hand. \r\n\r\nHe chose Saturday, 3:00 a.m. \r\n\r\nMost
    tenants would be asleep. The fire wouldn\u2019t be extinguished too quickly.
    His wife and daughter were spending the weekend at his mother-in-law\u2019s place
    in the countryside. And he himself \u2014 of course \u2014 would be perfectly
    absent, having gone out \u201Con a sudden late-night walk to clear his head.\u201D
    \r\n\r\nHe never thought anyone would die. \r\n\r\nOr rather, he did \u2014 but
    he convinced himself otherwise. The fire alarm would go off. The fire brigade
    would arrive. The tenants weren\u2019t idiots; they would run. At worst, a few
    floors would burn, the tenants would flee, and he would walk away with a check
    and a brand-new life. \r\n\r\nHe watched the flames rise from a caf\xE9 across
    the street. \r\n\r\nHis heart began to race. \r\n\r\nNot from fear. \r\n\r\nFrom
    excitement. \r\n\r\nWhen the windows on the fourth floor shattered and fire burst
    outward, he felt a pure, almost obscene thrill. \r\n\r\nThis was his fire. \r\nHis
    masterpiece. \r\nHe was burning down the past with his own hands \u2014 welcoming
    the future. \r\n\r\nThen his heart stopped. \r\n\r\nWhen he died, a twisted,
    liver-colored grin was still frozen on his face. "
