  backstory: "Richard Grey, forty-two years old, an insurance broker.\r\n\r\nHe lived
    on the fifth floor with his wife Luna and their ten-year-old son Jesse. They\u2019d
    been married for almost twenty years \u2014 childhood sweethearts, the kind of
    love story people told at dinner parties.\r\n\r\nRichard was a good provider.
    A good husband. A good father. That\u2019s what everyone said. That\u2019s what
    he believed.\r\n\r\nThe night of the fire, he woke to the smell of smoke and
    the sound of his son screaming.\r\n\r\nHe didn\u2019t think. He grabbed Jesse,
    wrapped him in a wet blanket, and ran for the stairs. Luna was right behind them
    \u2014 she\u2019d taken the fire escape.\r\n\r\nThe stairwell was chaos. Smoke.
    Heat. People pushing, shoving, stumbling over each other in the dark. Richard
    held Jesse tight against his chest and shouldered through.\r\n\r\nOn the third
    floor landing, he ran into the old man.\r\n\r\nHarold Pike. The landlord. Sixty-three
    years old, bad hip, slower than everyone else. He was blocking the stairs, fumbling
    with his cane, gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\u201CMove,\u201D Richard said.\r\n\r\nThe
    old man didn\u2019t move fast enough.\r\n\r\nRichard didn\u2019t remember making
    a decision. He just remembered his hands on the old man\u2019s shoulders. He
    remembered pushing. He remembered the sound Harold made as he tumbled down the
    stairs \u2014 a wet crack, then silence.\r\n\r\nHe didn\u2019t look back.\r\n\r\nHe
    got Jesse out. Luna met them on the street, crying, clutching them both. They
    were alive. They were together.\r\n\r\nRichard\u2019s burns were severe. Third
    degree across his back and arms. He\u2019d shielded Jesse with his own body when
    part of the ceiling collapsed.\r\n\r\nHe held on for three days in the burn unit.
    Jesse sat by his bed the whole time, holding his father\u2019s bandaged hand,
    telling him about school, about his friends, about the marbles he\u2019d won.\r\n\r\n\u201CTake
    care of your mother,\u201D Richard told him.\r\n\r\nThose were his last words.\r\n\r\nNo
    one ever found out about Harold. In the chaos of the fire, no one saw. No one
    asked. The old man\u2019s death was ruled an accident \u2014 he\u2019d fallen
    on the stairs while trying to escape.\r\n\r\nRichard took that secret to his
    grave.\r\n\r\nOr so he thought."
