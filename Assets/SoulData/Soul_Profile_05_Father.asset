  backstory: "Richard Grey, forty-two years old, an insurance broker.\r\n\r\nHe lived on the fifth floor with his wife Luna and their ten-year-old son Jesse. They'd been married for almost twenty years - childhood sweethearts, the kind of love story people told at dinner parties.\r\n\r\nRichard was a good provider. A good husband. A good father. That's what everyone said. That's what he believed.\r\n\r\nThe night of the fire, he woke to the smell of smoke and the sound of his son screaming.\r\n\r\nHe didn't think. He grabbed Jesse, wrapped him in a wet blanket, and ran for the stairs. Luna was right behind them - she'd taken the fire escape.\r\n\r\nThe stairwell was chaos. Smoke. Heat. People pushing, shoving, stumbling over each other in the dark. Richard held Jesse tight against his chest and shouldered through.\r\n\r\nOn the third floor landing, he ran into the old man.\r\n\r\nHarold Pike. The landlord. Sixty-three years old, bad hip, slower than everyone else. He was blocking the stairs, fumbling with his cane, gasping for breath.\r\n\r\n\"Move,\" Richard said.\r\n\r\nThe old man didn't move fast enough.\r\n\r\nRichard didn't remember making a decision. He just remembered his hands on the old man's shoulders. He remembered pushing. He remembered the sound Harold made as he tumbled down the stairs - a wet crack, then silence.\r\n\r\nHe didn't look back.\r\n\r\nHe got Jesse out. Luna met them on the street, crying, clutching them both. They were alive. They were together.\r\n\r\nRichard's burns were severe. Third degree across his back and arms. He'd shielded Jesse with his own body when part of the ceiling collapsed.\r\n\r\nHe held on for three days in the burn unit. Jesse sat by his bed the whole time, holding his father's bandaged hand, telling him about school, about his friends, about the marbles he'd won.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of your mother,\" Richard told him.\r\n\r\nThose were his last words.\r\n\r\nNo one ever found out about Harold. In the chaos of the fire, no one saw. No one asked. The old man's death was ruled an accident - he'd fallen on the stairs while trying to escape.\r\n\r\nRichard took that secret to his grave.\r\n\r\nOr so he thought."
